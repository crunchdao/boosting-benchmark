abstract: "Predictive modeling using machine learning techniques has gained significant attention in the field of finance for its potential to improve decision-making and forecasting accuracy. Gradient boosting algorithms, such as XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost, have shown promising results in various domains, including finance. This research paper presents a sbenchmarking study that evaluates the performance of these gradient boosting algorithms on financial data. The study follows a systematic process involving data collection, preprocessing, algorithm selection, feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter tuning, model evaluation, and performance comparison. Historical financial data, including stock prices, economic indicators, and company fundamentals, is utilized to predict financial outcomes. Evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) are employed to assess the predictive accuracy of the algorithms. The results of the benchmarking study provide insights into the comparative performance of the gradient boosting algorithms, taking into account metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The research findings contribute to the understanding of the suitability of different gradient boosting algorithms for financial prediction tasks and assist researchers and practitioners in making informed choices regarding algorithm selection in financial applications. Additionally, the study highlights areas for further exploration, including feature engineering techniques, hyperparameter tuning strategies, and model interpretability in the context of financial data."
